# Progress: ToDoApp Backend

## Current Status

**Phase**: Phase 1 Complete - Foundation Setup
**Date**: NestJS project successfully initialized

## What Works

- âœ… Memory Bank structure established
- âœ… Project documentation created
- âœ… Architecture patterns defined
- âœ… Technology stack planned
- âœ… NestJS project initialized with CLI
- âœ… Modular directory structure created
- âœ… Core dependencies installed (TypeORM, JWT, Passport, Swagger, etc.)
- âœ… Database configuration (PostgreSQL + TypeORM)
- âœ… Environment configuration setup
- âœ… Core module with global filters and interceptors
- âœ… Shared module with validation service
- âœ… Global validation pipes configured
- âœ… Swagger documentation setup
- âœ… Docker Compose for database
- âœ… Enhanced npm scripts
- âœ… TypeScript compilation errors fixed
- âœ… Application successfully running on localhost:3000
- âœ… API endpoints working with proper response format
- âœ… Swagger documentation accessible at /api/docs

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 2: Authentication (Next)

- [ ] User entity and database table
- [ ] User registration endpoint
- [ ] User login endpoint
- [ ] JWT authentication middleware
- [ ] Password hashing and validation

### Phase 2: Authentication

- [ ] User entity and database table
- [ ] User registration endpoint
- [ ] User login endpoint
- [ ] JWT authentication middleware
- [ ] Password hashing and validation

### Phase 3: Core Task Management

- [ ] Task entity and database table
- [ ] Task CRUD endpoints
  - [ ] POST /tasks (create)
  - [ ] GET /tasks (list user's tasks)
  - [ ] GET /tasks/:id (get single task)
  - [ ] PUT /tasks/:id (update)
  - [ ] DELETE /tasks/:id (delete)
- [ ] Task status management
- [ ] User-task relationship

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features

- [ ] Category entity and endpoints
- [ ] Task categories assignment
- [ ] Priority levels
- [ ] Due dates
- [ ] Task filtering and search
- [ ] Pagination

### Phase 5: Quality & Production

- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger)
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Deployment preparation

## Current Issues

- None identified yet

## Technical Debt

- None currently

## Performance Metrics

- Not yet measurable (no implementation)

## Next Immediate Action

Begin Phase 2: Authentication implementation starting with User entity creation and JWT authentication setup.

## Notes

- âœ… Successfully following workspace NestJS guidelines
- âœ… Modular architecture properly implemented
- âœ… Clean, testable code structure established
- ðŸ”„ Ready for authentication implementation
- Database requires Docker to be running (use `npm run db:up`)
- API documentation available at `/api/docs` when running
