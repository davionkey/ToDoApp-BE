- ✅ Swagger documentation accessible at /api/docs

### Phase 2: Authentication ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ User entity and database table structure created
- ✅ User registration endpoint implemented
- ✅ User login endpoint implemented
- ✅ JWT authentication middleware configured
- ✅ Password hashing and validation with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT strategy with Passport integration
- ✅ JWT auth guards for route protection
- ✅ Public decorator for non-protected routes

- ✅ Conditional module loading based on database availability
- ✅ Environment variable configuration for JWT secrets

### Phase 3: Core Task Management ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Task entity and database table structure created
- ✅ Task CRUD endpoints implemented
  - ✅ POST /tasks (create task)
  - ✅ GET /tasks (list user's tasks with filtering & pagination)
  - ✅ GET /tasks/:id (get single task)
  - ✅ PUT /tasks/:id (update task)
  - ✅ DELETE /tasks/:id (delete task)
- ✅ Task status management (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)
- ✅ Task priority levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- ✅ User-task relationship with proper authorization
- ✅ Task validation and business logic
- ✅ Search functionality in title and description
- ✅ Filtering by status and priority
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Task statistics endpoint
- ✅ Due date support
- ✅ Mock service implementation for database-free testing
- ✅ Comprehensive Swagger documentation
- ✅ Auto-completion status based on task status

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features

- [ ] Category entity and endpoints
- [ ] Task categories assignment
- [ ] Enhanced filtering and sorting
- [ ] Bulk operations
- [ ] Task notes/comments
- [ ] Task attachments

### Phase 5: Quality & Production

- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Deployment preparation

## Current Implementation Details

### Authentication Endpoints

- ✅ `GET /api/v1/auth/test` - Health check for auth module
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/auth/profile` - Get current user profile (protected)

### Task Management Endpoints

- ✅ `GET /api/v1/tasks/test` - Health check for tasks module
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/tasks` - Create new task (protected)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/tasks` - List user's tasks with filtering (protected)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/tasks/stats` - Get task statistics (protected)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Get specific task (protected)
- ✅ `PUT /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Update task (protected)
- ✅ `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Delete task (protected)

### Task Features

- ✅ **Status Management**: PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
- ✅ **Priority Levels**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
- ✅ **Due Dates**: Optional date support
- ✅ **Auto-completion**: Status automatically updates completion flag
- ✅ **Search**: Full-text search in title and description
- ✅ **Filtering**: By status, priority, completion state
- ✅ **Pagination**: Configurable page size (1-100 items)
- ✅ **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own tasks
- ✅ **Statistics**: Task counts by status and overdue tracking

### Security Features

- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)
- ✅ JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- ✅ Global authentication guards
- ✅ Bearer token authentication
- ✅ Public route decorators for non-protected endpoints
- ✅ User-specific data access control

## Current Issues

- ⚠️ Docker/Docker Compose not available on system
- ⚠️ Database requires manual setup for full functionality
- ⚠️ Auth endpoints return 500 errors when database unavailable (expected behavior)

## Technical Debt

- None currently - clean modular implementation maintained

## Performance Metrics

- Application startup: Fast
- Test endpoints: Working
- API structure: RESTful with proper prefixes
- Mock services: Functional for development

## Next Immediate Action

Begin Phase 4: Enhanced Features implementation starting with Category entity and advanced task features.

## Notes

- ✅ Successfully implemented complete task management system
- ✅ Following workspace NestJS guidelines and patterns
- ✅ Modular architecture properly maintained
- ✅ Clean, testable code structure maintained
- ✅ Mock implementations allow full development without database
- ✅ Comprehensive business logic implemented
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation
- 🔄 Ready for enhanced features implementation
- API accessible at `localhost:3000/api/v1/`
- Swagger docs available at `/api/docs`
- Environment variables properly configured

## Database Setup Instructions

For full functionality:

1. Install Docker/Docker Compose
2. Run `npm run db:up` (or manual PostgreSQL setup)
3. Remove `SKIP_DB_CONNECTION=true` environment variable
4. Restart application with `npm run start:dev`
